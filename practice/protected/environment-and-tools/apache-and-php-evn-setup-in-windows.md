# steps for reference
This [page](https://www.apachelounge.com/viewtopic.php?t=2394) could be a very good reference.

- Go the page [Using Apache HTTP Server on Microsoft Windows](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/platform/windows.html#down) on apache official site. Basicly, there could be several choices as below:
  - ApacheHaus
  - Apache Lounge
  - Bitnami WAMP Stack
  - WampServer
  - XAMPP  

In my case I do neither need MySQL or MariaDB, nor perl. So I just install Apache http server and PHP.
- Go to [Apache Lounge](https://www.apachelounge.com/download/)'s home page and [PHP](https://windows.php.net/download/)'s download page, and just install and configure everything according the [page](https://www.apachelounge.com/viewtopic.php?t=2394) mentioned above. Just suggest the fast CGI module is a better choice for the installation.
